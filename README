JAX is a PHP4 MVC framework that was originally developed by me while I was
doing consulting for clients. It was ported to PHP5 and continues to be used on
a few sites. Framework is JAX's PHP5 cousin. I've upladed this for historical
purposes and so people can laugh at me.

This code is NOT used anymore and is NOT supported. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
