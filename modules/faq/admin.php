Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) are broken up into categories. In order to 
add a FAQ you need to first create a few categoreis (ie. "Company", "Products",
"Services", etc.). Remember that when you delete a category you delete all of the FAQ's in that category.

FAQ's can be easily added via the admin form. FAQ's should be short and concise
answers to questions you hear from your customers often (ie. "When was your 
company founded?", "Does product X support Y?", etc.).
